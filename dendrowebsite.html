<h1>African Fauna</h1>

<p> Africa is host to a massive ecological range, consisting of over 3,000 species of fish, 100,000 species of insect, 238 species of amphibian, 2600 species of bird, and 1100 species of mammal. This page aims to give the reader a general understanding of the beautiful and bizzare wildlife of the African continent.</p>

<p> The first fossils we know of from Africa are 3 types of rodent which crossed from Asia to Africa in the Middle Miocene. These species, from the subfamilies Myocricetodontinae, Democricetodontinae, and Dendromurinae, were likely omnivorous by nature, feeding off of grains and insects to survive.</p>

<p> The modern creatures of Africa are largely shaped by its climate. Two thirds of Africa is tropical by size, meaning animals needed to evolve various ways to avoid overheating. African Elephants have large ears to release heat, lions can expel excess warmth with their tongues, and aquatic animals like Hippos and Crocodiles submerge themselves in water to stay cool. </p>

<p>Africas rich biodiversity is not safe however. In 2023 alone, 35,800,000,000,000 (thirty-five trillion eight-hundred billion) kilograms of CO2 were released into the atmosphere. The African continent is especially susceptible to the effects of this man-made pollution, with some scientist claiming it as the most vulnerable continent. Droughts and extreme rainfall will make food for both animals and people harder to come by, while oceanic acidification will kill off biodiversity in the seas. The full extent of the damage climate change will wreak on this continent is unclear, though we know we should be doing everything in our power to stop further destruction.</p>
