<h1>Nile Crocodile</h1>

<p> The Nile crocodiles are widely distributed across sub-Saharan Africa, spending their time in rivers, swamps, and marshlands. They are carnivorous by nature, and hide in water to catch unsuspecting prey such as antelope and zebra. Once an animal has been ensnared in their jaws, they can perform a 'death roll', rolling their entire body to twist limbs off their prey.</p>
