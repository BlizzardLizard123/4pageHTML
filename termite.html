<h1>Termites</h1>

<p> Termites are social insects in the order Blattodea. Despite their appearance, they are closer related to cockroaches than they are to ants. They are social animals, building massive nests extruding from the ground that can be more than 12 meters tall. They eat mainly cellulose rich foods such as wood and leaves, and they are eaten themselves by aardvarks and anteaters. They are found in forested areas and prefer temperate climates. Over 50 quadrillion termites are estimated to live in Africa alone, comprising roughly 500,000,000 metric tonnes of biomass. If you were to weigh them against every person in Africa, the termites would outweigh the people five times over.
